        <h3>More on The History of <strong>Wotowoto</strong></h3>
        <p>During early July, my mates and I were standing in front of the chemistry laboratory of our <a href="http://www.alfareedschools.com/">school</a>, then Ahmad tied himself to a pole and everyone was touching his buttocks, Fawaz wanted to try the same so that he'd get a buttock massage.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then out of the blue,  <strong>Adewolu </strong> landed a slap on his face , it was incredible and of course all of us had to join in the fun, we beat fawaz for about a minute  and then we realized how incredible it felt and we didn't want it to stop so we did it continously by tying other mates of ours to the pole and beating them</p>
        <p><em>Summarily</em>, Adewolu is the first person to beat wotowoto and Fawaz is the first person to <strong>collect</strong> wotowoto. They both made history that day.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We had so much fun on that day and of course, the #1 fun killer, Mr. Adedeji was there to end it</p>
        <br>
        <p>Fast forward to today where the top three <strong><em>collectors of Wotowoto</em></strong> are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Oladosu Muhammad a.k.a  <em> Dosu</em></li>
            <li>Salimon Abdus-salam    a.k.a <em>Salimoh</em></li>
            <li>Olayiwola Lukman a.k.a   <em> Eluku Sars</em></li>
        </ul>
